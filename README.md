# Among Us Auto Mute Discord Mod

# How it works?
It works by injecting a dll that has been compiled with the program. It will hook onto Among Us and Discord!
Please ensure that Among Us and Discord are installed in the defualt directorys.
When  a game starts, it calls an audo file which is the sound of when your role is chosen. And when a meeting is over the same thing happens.
This program waits for the audio files to be called and once detected, it will call the mute function on Discord.
Sound simple but it was a challenge to code this!

# Important 
This program can be placed on your Desktop, Downloads or documents files. You might exprience issues if you place this anywhere else like in a folder on your desktop. DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM. Also, if it detects as a virus that is just because it reads the data of Among Us and Discord to know when to mute your microphone.
